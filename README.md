## 🔥 Season 1 – Burnout

You begin in the **Nether** — no access to the Overworld unless you can construct the portal (*Not the vanilla one*) with Nether-exclusive resources. After **5 real-world days**, a gateway opens to the surface, and the race for domination begins.

Three weeks after the server launches, all players are put into **permadeath** mode. Location tracking starts. The war begins.
